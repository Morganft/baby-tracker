# Backlog

Non-critical items deferred from delivery. Each: `- [<area>] <what> — <why it can wait>`.

## 2026-07-09 — Step 2 (data access + JSON API)

- [api] `PATCH /api/sleeps/[id]` doesn't enforce `endTime ≥ startTime` the way create does — an edit could produce a negative-duration entry (engine would misread it as a too-short nap). Not on the happy path; the Step-3 edit UI will constrain times. Fix needs the stored row for the cross-field check.
- [api] `parseTemplate` accepts negative / non-integer `wakeWindows` and `expectedNapDurations`, and `parseSleepCreate` accepts any epoch — informational-only per REQUIREMENTS, but negative windows yield nonsensical projections. Add sanity floors when the template-editor UI lands (Step 4).
- [perf] `assembleDay` full-scans `sleep_entry` on every call — fine at current scale; add a start-time range filter (today ± 1 day) once history grows.
- [style] `toActiveDTO` casts the active-template row through `as unknown as TemplateRow`; harmless but a shared column type would be cleaner.
